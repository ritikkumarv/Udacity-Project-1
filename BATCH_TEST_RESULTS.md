## Recommendations

**For Production Use: VGG**
- Best accuracy and reliability
- Acceptable 16-second runtime
- Minimal false positives/negatives

**For Development/Testing: ResNet**
- Good balance of speed (2 sec) and accuracy
- Fast iteration during development

**For Real-Time Applications: AlexNet**
- Fastest (1 sec)
- Acceptable accuracy for speed-critical needs

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Review detailed comparison in `MODEL_COMPARISON.md`
2. ‚úÖ Choose the best model for your use case
3. ‚úÖ Integrate chosen model into production
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider fixing PyTorch deprecation warnings (optional)
